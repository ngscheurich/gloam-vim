## Prior Art

gloam is heavily based on two of my favorite colorschemes,
[tender](https://github.com/jacoborus/tender.vim) and
[Greenery](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/nova-theme). In fact, itâ€™s
essentially a palette swap of tender, using mostly the Greenery colors.
Just as tender is, gloam is generated by [Estilo](https://github.com/jacoborus/estilo)
and the [gloam header image](https://github.com/ngscheurich/gloam-vim) is a direct
remix of [tenderâ€™s](https://github.com/ngscheurich/gloam-vim).

Many thanks to [@jacoborus](https://github.com/jacoborus/) and
[@Jaredk3nt](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt) for their hard work!

## Installation

Install manually, or using the package manager of your choice:

```viml
" vim-plug
Plug 'ngscheurich/gloam.vim'

" NeoBundle
NeoBundle 'ngscheurich/gloam.vim'

" Vundle
Plugin 'ngscheurich/gloam.vim'
```

Once installed, set the colorscheme in your `.vimrc` or `init.vim`:

```viml
" Vim >=8.0 or Neovim >= 0.1.5
if (has("termguicolors"))
 set termguicolors
endif

" Neovim 0.1.3 and 0.1.4
let $NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR=1

# Enable syntax highlighting and set colorscheme
syntax enable
colorscheme gloam
```

You can use the included [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
theme like:

```viml
let g:airline_theme = 'gloam'
```

Fix for MacVim (see: [issue](https://github.com/jacoborus/tender.vim/issues/9)):

```viml
let macvim_skip_colorscheme = 1
```

If you like gloam-vim and are an [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) user, you should
check out [gloam-iterm2](https://github.com/ngscheurich/gloam-iterm2).

## Roadmap

I plan to add aditional syntax themes for some of the languages I work
in frequently, including:

* [ ] Elixir
* [ ] Lua
* [ ] GDScript
